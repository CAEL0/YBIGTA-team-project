This data contains the location and circumstances of every field goal attempted by Kobe Bryant took during his 20-year career. Your task is to predict whether the basket went in (shot_made_flag).

We have removed 5000 of the shot_made_flags (represented as missing values in the csv file). These are the test set shots for which you must submit a prediction. You are provided a sample submission file with the correct shot_ids needed for a valid prediction.

To avoid leakage, your method should only train on events that occurred prior to the shot for which you are predicting! Since this is a playground competition with public answers, it's up to you to abide by this rule.
