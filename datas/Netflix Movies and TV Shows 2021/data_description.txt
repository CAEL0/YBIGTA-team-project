Context
This is my first dataset on Kaggle. I had great fun creating this dataset and learned a ton. If found useful, please upvote.

Content
This dataset contains all the listed movies and TV shows on Netflix as of 2021. The dataset was collected from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine.

Acknowledgements
Firstly, I would like to thank Shivamb as a similar dataset for Netflix content was available. There were two shortcomings with the previously available database. Firstly, it was of the year 2019. Secondly, (which is the more important part), IMDb rating for the movies and TV shows was missing. This is a very important feature, especially when it comes to building recommendation algorithms.
